  <h1>My Trip to the Camp</h1>

  <!-- Day 1 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>When we arrived on Friday it was a pretty warm day. We set up our tents for that night and walked around the camp a bit.</p>

  <!-- Day 2 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>Day two we woke up and ate eggs and toast, then went to do activities. The events we did were ball throwing, Bozo buckets, duck squirting, ball collecting (or something like that), and the fruit bucket game. I really liked the games because we broke THREE records for duck squirting, Bozo buckets, and ball throwing. At the end of the night, thanks to our valiant efforts, we got third place for the first time in a while apparently. After the places got announced at the end of the day, we ate dinner and then went to sleep.</p>
