    <h1>My Trip to the Camp</h1>

    <div class="post">
  <h2>Day 1</h2>
  <p>When we arrived on Friday it was a pretty warm day. We set up our tents for that night and walked around the camp a bit. I slept in a big tent with Dom and Lincon. Pitching the tent wasn't easy because  the tent was MASSIVE (just like the low taper fade meme) to set the tent up me Dom Lincoln and Mr.Perez working together.</p>

    <div class="post">
      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <p>Day two we woke up and ate eggs and toast, then went to do activities. The events we did were ball throwing, Bozo buckets, duck squirting, ball collecting (or something like that), and the fruit bucket game. I really liked the games because we broke THREE records for duck squirting, Bozo buckets, and ball throwing.After the ball collecting game we ate lunch which was hotdogs and watermelon. At the end of the day, thanks to our valiant efforts, we got third place for the first time in a while apparently. After we ate dinner  which was fried chicken and fries,then went to sleep.</p>

      <p>We woke up at 6:30 AM and packed up the tents. Then we left the camp and drove back with Mr.Perez in his van and got back at around 8:45 AM.</p>
